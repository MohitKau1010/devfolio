## Code of Conduct
### Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Use of portfolio
You are free to use this template as your own by making any changes to it, but please make sure to at least give credits to the owner of this repo.

### Reporting
If you see any issue about the repo, please be advised its an open source project so you can open the PR to fix the issue rather than bashing it on LinkedIn with mistakes and issues you are facing. Of course, code is never perfect!
